3)Technologies Used:
Ruby and Ruby on Rails git and github API

4)I enjoy use Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.  This is the second project that I used it for creating a backend for my website. The more I use it, the more I am learning about it.It is always dificult for me to decide how many tables to use for the project.  I would like to explore using Rails with more tables.  I look forward to using Ruby and Ruby on Rails more in the future.  


FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS-
I would like to be able to able to add the images to the database instead of storing them in the project.  I also would also like to be able set up the backend so users can upload their own pictures.
